Among Gen Z (aged 18‚Äì27) and Gen Y (aged 28‚Äì41), 13% and 18% respectively have made investments, in stark contrast to the 4% of Baby Boomers (aged 58‚Äì74).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Smaller Investments Driven by Curiosity</strong></h3>\n<p>For most Swiss crypto investors, the financial stakes remain modest. About 31% of respondents hold less than CHF1,000 in cryptocurrencies. This trend reflects the experimental nature of many investments. The primary motivation cited by 71% of investors is curiosity or personal interest, while 50% are driven by the potential for returns.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúReturns and diversification of portfolios play a role,‚Äù the study notes, ‚Äúbut for many, they remain secondary motivations.‚Äù</p>\n<h3><strong>Popular Platforms and Providers</strong></h3>\n<p>The study also sheds light on where Swiss investors prefer to trade cryptocurrencies.
